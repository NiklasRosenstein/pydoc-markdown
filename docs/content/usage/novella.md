# Getting started

  [Novella]: https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/novella/

When using the Pydoc-Markdown integration with [Novella][] to make use of its Markdown pre-processing capabilities,
Pydoc-Markdown comes as a plugin that provides a `@pydoc` and `@pylink` tag to insert Markdown documentation 
generated by Pydoc-Markdown in the corresponding places of your documentation.

## Installation

When using Pipx, the recommended installation method is to inject Pydoc-Markdown later:

    $ pipx install novella
    $ pipx inject novella pydoc-markdown[novella]

If you manage the environment yourself, it's sufficient to install Pydoc-Markdown with the `novella` extra.

    $ pip install pydoc-markdown[novella]

## Configuration

A Novella build is configured using a `build.novella` script. In most cases you want to rely on a template provided
by Novella, such as the MkDocs template. Check out the Novella documentation to find what types of templates
are available [here](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/novella/components/templates_/).

```py title="docs/build.novella"
template "mkdocs" {
  content_directory = "content"
}

action "preprocess-markdown" {
  use "pydoc"
}
```

What is happening here?

1. The `mkdocs` pipeline template is applied. The `content_directory` is the directory that contains your MkDocs
   source files. It will be copied to the temporary build location alongside the `mkdocs.yml` file. Note that your
   `build.novella` script should sit next two these files.

2. The `preprocess-markdown` action that is one of the actions created by the template is retrieved and configured
   further. We instruct it to make use of the `"pydoc"` plugin, which is implemented by Pydoc-Markdown and provides
   the `@pydoc` and `{@pylink}` tags.

!!! note

    * The `content/` directory is the default so it does not need to be set explicitly and it is sufficient to write
      `template "mkdocs"` (without an empty configuration block).
    
    * The `mkdocs` template will apply a default configuration delivered with Novella to your MkDocs configuration. If
      you don't want this, you can configure the `"mkdocs-update-config"` action to disable this. Note that you can
      also have no MkDocs configuration file and the template will create a default file for you.
    
    * The `pydoc` tag is implemented in {@pylink pydoc_markdown.novella.preprocessor.PydocTagPreprocessor}. Look it
      up to understand how it can be configured further.

    * The `pydoc` tag processor applies a heuristic to populate the default search path for your Python source
      code. If the directory in which the build is executed is called `docs` or `documentation`, it will default to
      `[ "../src", ".." ]`, otherwise it will default to `[ "src", "." ]`.

## Using Novella tags

For example, the `@cat` tag is useful to inject the content of another file.

```py title="docs/content/index.md"
# Welcome to my Project documentation!

\@cat ../../readme.md :with slice_lines = "2:"
```

The `@pydoc` tag is the piece provided by Pydoc-Markdown itself. It uses the {@pylink
pydoc_markdown.contrib.renderers.markdown.MarkdownRenderer} to generate Markdown formatted API documentation of
the API object you specify.

```py title="docs/content/api.md"
# API Documentation

\@pydoc my_module.SomeClass
```

## Build the documentation

Change into the `docs/` directory where your `build.novella` script resides and invoke the Novella CLI. The MkDocs
template exposes some command-line arguments that you can pass through the CLI, one of which is the `--serve` option
that runs MkDocs in the server mode instead of building the documentation and writing it to disk.

``` title="$ novella --help"
@shell novella --help
```

## Advantages over the YAML Configuration

The {@link yaml-config} allows you to define in one file all pages and the Python API objects they should contain.
However, when you use Novella, each page will need to exist as a Markdown file. This has a few advantages:

* __Easier to understand__; The YAML `pages` configuration could be hard to reason about, while having an actual
  file for each page is much more human friendly and actually resembles the project structure for the static site
  generator in use.
* __1-to-1 mapping__; Each page in the final documentation is represented by a file in the source project, allowing
  things like the "Edit URL" generated by MkDocs to point to the actual page source rather than a 404 page.
* __Mixing static and generated content__; Placing generated API documentation where the `@pydoc` tag is used in the
  Markdown page allows you to put static documentation content around it.

Now, if you still want to generate Markdown files at build time, Pydoc-Markdown does not currently provide any
functionality to do that; although some discussion around the topic is happening in [#245][]. However, the Novella
build script is just code, so if you really need it, you can generate the files there:

  [#245]: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pydoc-markdown/discussions/254

```py title="docs/build.novella"
template "mkdocs"

def api_pages = {
  "SomeClass": "my_module.SomeClass",
  # ...
}

action "mkdocs-update-config" {
  site_name = "My module"
  profile = "readthedocs"
  update_with config -> {
    def items = []
    for title, package in api_pages.items():
      items.append({ title: 'api/{}.md'.format(package) })
    config['nav'].append({ 'API Documentation': items })
  }
}

action "preprocess-markdown" {
  use "pydoc"
}

do
  name: "generate-api-pages"
  closure: {
    # Make sure that this action runs before the Markdown preprocessors.
    precedes "preprocess-markdown"
  }
  action: {
    for title, package in api_pages.items():
      def path = directory / 'content' / 'api' / (package + '.md')
      path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
      path.write_text('---\ntitle: {}\n---\n@pydoc {}\n'.format(title, package))
  }
```
